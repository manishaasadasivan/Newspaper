                <p class="header">Throughout history, Pakistan has been an important element in the US foreign policy in Afghanistan particularly in relation to the peace process.</p>
                <img src="headline.PNG" width="100%">
                <p>On 19 January, General (retired) Lloyd Austin, president-elect Joe Biden's pick to become the United States (US) Secretary of Defence, spoke at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing and emphasised that he will put pressure on Pakistan to prevent it from allowing its territory to be used as a sanctuary for militants and violent extremist organisations. On a separate note, however, the defence secretary nominee has shown a keen desire to enhance the US-India strategic partnership and bolster the overall arrangement of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). These statements illustrate how a Biden administration may recalibrate the US' South Asia policy and preserve India's role as a status quo regional leader.</p>

                <h1>Spotted in India: Humans and leopards living in harmony</h1>
                <p>In 2020, leopards killed 35 people in the state of Maharashtra, the highest in a decade. Further north, in the state of Uttarakhand, as of October 2020, leopard attacks had claimed 24 lives, a sharp 30 per cent increase from the previous year.<br>

                    These clashes often lead to leopards being killed or captured and released elsewhere away from human settlements, despite research indicating that these methods do not reduce the number of attacks. In some cases, translocation has led to increased attacks. 
                    
                    “The thing is that the conflict is an old one, [but] the method to treat the conflict hasn’t really changed,” says Sanjay Sondhi, founder of Titli Trust, a nature conservation non-profit based in Uttarakhand.</p>
                    <img src="lepoard.PNG" width="100%">
                    <p>A Senior Scientific Director at Wildlife Conservation Society India (WCS-India), Dr Athreya’s research in Maharashtra had led her to collaborate with the state’s forest department to start Mumbaikars for SGNP, a programme that sees citizens lead the way in engaging the community on learning to live safely alongside leopards. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite the long history of leopard-human conflict in Uttarakhand, Sanjay was encouraged by the findings of a survey on attitudes towards leopards, which was conducted with Dr Athreya.  

                        “People were very tolerant towards leopards. Uttarakhand is a hill state and people have grown up with wild animals throughout their lives,” he points out.
